Hochschulsport as if it's 2024 again.
Automatically book your favourite course without having to remember to book the same course _every damn week_ via the stupid app. 

# Usage

In short: Create an initial `tokens.json` file with contents of your browser cookie (delcom_auth). Execute the script regularly (e.g. once a day) in a cron job with the correct arguments for your course. Done!

For more details see `./autohsp --help`.
